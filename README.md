Late ASM 2024/2025 Manuscript Figures

Fig. 1 - Atmospheric and surface land and ocean conditions prior and during the official ASM onset in early February 2025.
Fig. 3 - A comparison of the ASM and RS indices from September 2024 to February 2025 
Fig. 4 - Tropical Indo-Pacific sea surface temperatures (SST) anomalies derived from ERSSTv5
Suppl Fig. 1 - October 2024 - January 2025 mean rainfall anomalies (mm) calculated from three different climatological reference periods: (a) 1961-1990, (b) 1981-2010, and (c) 1991-2020. 
Suppl Fig. 2 - Reconstructed monthly rainfall anomalies over northern Australia (112°-154°E, 10°-29°S) for (a-h) December 2024 and (i-p) January 2025, based on a multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis using standardized climate indices affecting Australia’s rainfall (namely ENSO, IOD, MJO and the SAM).
Suppl Fig. 3 - Comparison of the official historical ASM onset dates (D96) and onset dates from seven different ASM and rainy season onset definitions from 1 September to 1 March.
Suppl Fig. 4 - A comparison of the ASM indices from September 2024 to February 2025 (inclusive) at Weipa Aero (12.68°S, 141.92°E). 
Suppl Fig. 6 - Distribution of RMM1 and RMM2 values on the MJO phase space diagram for monsoon onset dates identified using the official (D96) ASM onset definition. 
Suppl Fig. 7 - 5-day centered averages of zonal shear line at 850 hPa (0 m/s zonal wind, indicated by solid blue lines), rainfall (colors; mm), mean sea level pressure (MSLP, contours; hPa) and winds at 850 hPa (vectors; m/s) over Australia for different monsoon onset dates, based on the ASM definitions considered: (a) NRO, (b) U21, (c) T61, (d) HY04, (e) N82, (f) H86 and HL90, and (g) D96.
