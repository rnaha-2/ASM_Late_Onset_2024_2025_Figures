# Late ASM 2024/2025 Manuscript Figures:

Brief description of the figures in All_figures.ipynb

Fig. 1 - Atmospheric and surface land and ocean conditions prior and during the official ASM onset in February 2025. Shown are 3-day accumulated rainfall totals from 4 to 6 February 2025 (shaded colors over land; mm), 850 hPa geopotential height (contours; m) and winds (vectors; m/s). Average sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) from 15 December 2024 to 6 February 2025 (shaded colors over ocean; °C) are calculated from a December-January 30-year climatology (1991-2020). 

Fig. 2 - Tropical Indo-Pacific SST anomalies derived from ERSSTv5. (a) SST anomalies for January 2025, calculated relative to a 1991-2020 climatology. (b) Monthly NINO3.4 index (ONI) and relative NINO3.4 index (RONI) from August 2024 to March 2025, and (c) monthly Dipole Mode Index (DMI) from June 2024 to January 2025.

Fig. 3 - Air temperature conditions at 9am (grey) and 3pm (purple) local time (a) dew point temperatures and (b) wet bulb temperatures at Darwin Airport averaged across each January for 1955-2025. Larger circles indicate the January 2025 averages. (c) Difference between January 2025 monthly maximum temperatures and the previous January record (dots) for 10 weather stations across coastal Northern Territory (NT) and northwest Queensland (QLD). 

Fig. 4 - A comparison of ASM and RS indices from September 2024 to February 2025. Shown are (left panels) the ASM indices, including (a) the official ASM onset (D96), (b) H86, (c) HL90, and (d) HY04. Also shown are (right column) the RS indices, including (e) N82 and NRO, (f) U21 and (g) T61.

Fig. 5 - The MJO phases and total and anomalous OLR variations (over northern Australia) from September 2024 to mid-February 2025. (a-c) the MJO during (a) 1 September to 31 October, (b) 1 November to 31 December, and (c) 1 January to 15 February. (d) Variations in the total daily OLR (thick colored line) over northern Australia (120°-150°E, 10°-20°S) plotted against a long-term (1981-2020) mean (curved dotted black line).

Suppl Fig. 1 - October 2024 - January 2025 mean rainfall anomalies (mm) calculated from three different climatological reference periods: (a) 1961-1990, (b) 1981-2010, and (c) 1991-2020. 

Suppl Fig. 2 - Reconstructed monthly rainfall anomalies over northern Australia (112°-154°E, 10°-29°S) for (a-h) December 2024 and (i-p) January 2025, based on a multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis using standardized climate indices affecting Australia’s rainfall (namely ENSO, IOD, MJO and the SAM).

Suppl Fig. 3 - Comparison of the official historical ASM onset dates (D96) and onset dates from seven different ASM and rainy season onset definitions from 1 September to 1 March.

Suppl Fig. 4 - A comparison of the ASM indices from September 2024 to February 2025 (inclusive) at Weipa Aero (12.68°S, 141.92°E). 

Suppl Fig. 6 - Distribution of RMM1 and RMM2 values on the MJO phase space diagram for monsoon onset dates identified using the official (D96) ASM onset definition. 

Suppl Fig. 7 - 5-day centered averages of zonal shear line at 850 hPa (0 m/s zonal wind, indicated by solid blue lines), rainfall (colors; mm), mean sea level pressure (MSLP, contours; hPa) and winds at 850 hPa (vectors; m/s) over Australia for different monsoon onset dates, based on the ASM definitions considered: (a) NRO, (b) U21, (c) T61, (d) HY04, (e) N82, (f) H86 and HL90, and (g) D96.
